> I don't want to be on my phone, but I can't put it down. - Anonymous Friend #TODO turn this into a quote about average screentime

You've heard it before: "Your phone is killing your attention span and stealing your time!" I don't disagree. It's certainly eaten more of my life than I'd be proud to say. Many of us know the harm and feel the dissatisfaction of hours spent scrolling. And when we can't stop ourselves we point to willpower, energy, time, none of it is enough. 

I don't think we're wrong about that either. Willpower does really feel like it runs out, and when you do a full day's work, there's no shame in being tired. However, I think we are wrong about one thing: that *will* is what's holding us back.

Duckworth et al. in their paper "Situational strategies for self-control" put it best:

> "People with high self-control are often described as having an extraordinary capacity to resist temptation. However, our findings suggest that rather than being better at overcoming temptation through heroic feats of willpower, individuals with high self-control are better at arranging their lives so as to avoid encountering it in the first place."

If that's the case, the question is: **How do we arrange our lives to avoid encountering temptation in the first place?**

This time last year I was averaging 3.5 hours of phone screentime a day - mostly on reddit, instgram, and youtube.I hated it.

As someone who believes that a life IS the moments it's comprised of, the thought of my life being ~1/6th scrolling (4hrs/24hrs), just half of what I spend sleeping, filled me with a deep sense of existential dread. Yet, even that wasn't enough to stop me. Will wasn't enough to stop me.

Now, I'm not saying willpower is fake. What I am saying is that I wouldn't bet my time - my life - on it. Instead I am slowly and steadily arranging my life so as to avoid needing will in the first place - that way when I really do have to rely on it, I haven't exhausted my supply. This is how.


## Avoiding Will Exhaustion: Building an ecosystem of self-administered nudges

Avoid using will, instead shape your environment using nudges
- What is a nudge/choice architecture
- example of how it worked on the public
- example of how I apply it
- example of how famous productivity people do it.

 To reduce the *need* to rely on willpower, I use what are called Nudges - minimally invasive interventions that make use of known biases in decision making to *nudge* you in the direction of a better choice [Thaler et al.]. Essentially, instead of trying to force myself through brute strength or punishment to choose to read a book instead of scrolling reddit I try to increase the odds that I'll choose to read the book with what's called Choice Architecture. For example I can make it easier to choose reading (architecting my choice) by:
 
 1. decreasing friction of the "good" choice: put the book out in the open by the couch where I relax
 2. increasing friction of the "bad" choice: putting my phone across the room
 3. making the "bad" thing less appealing: turning my phone screen black and white
 4. and so on ...

What's amazing is the scales at which this type of intervention can work. Researchers in behavioural-economics, psychology, and Human-Computer Interaction, have deployed tons of these choice architecture or nudge interventions to increase the amount of vegetables grocery shoppers buy, help students decide to start their homework earlier, and decrease screentime [#CITE G something, JJW, One-sec app guy's thesis]. Nudges seem to be a consistently effective way to change behaviour for the better.

Beyond the science, productivity experts have gravitated toward Choice Architecture and nudges too. The immensely successful self-help book *Atomic Habits* by James Clear is founded on the idea of building up habits by making the choices you want to make easier, and the choices you don't want to make harder over time. But don't take my word for it, Clear says it best himself *Four Laws of Behaviour Change* are:

> Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, and Make it Satisfying. 


 






The approach I've been using is building an ecosystem self-administered nudges to help me be more intentional and make the choices I actually want to make about how to spend my time.

The idea is based on Thaler et al's book, Nudge. where they introduce the concept of minimally invasive interventions that make choosing one option 


This whole idea is Put plainly, Choice Architecture or Nudges are minimally invasive ways that you can shape your environment to increase the odds you make one choice over another [Thaler]. For exa

This is based on the thesis of Nudge by Thaler and the core practice of [my supervisor's lab at UofT](https://www.josephjaywilliams.com/home). The idea is 



### Dumbing Down the Phone I already have

Okay, so you may have seen the "dumbphone" trend. A lot of folks buying new phones that CANT install the apps that drain our attention. While I respect the goal, I'm wary of two things:

1. 2FA: With 2 or multi factor authentication becoming the norm, not being able to insteall auth apps to authenticate login requests makes it really difficult to work or access my own accounts.
2. Having a dumbphone instead of using my phone less: I'm worried that I'll spend the money on a dumbphone so that I can replace the goal of reducing my phone usage, with buying something that represents achieving that goal. Then, because I'll have announced to the world that I bought a dumbphone, I can feel satisfied and go back to scrolling on the phone I actually use.

To avoid these two things, I decided to dumb down the phone I do have (iphone 12 mini) to make it as untempting as possible while stil allowing me to authenticate with MFA wihtout buying anything new. So far, it's working.

#### Turn off Notifications by Default
The single best thing I did for myself was turning off notifications by default and setting my phone to silent at all times of the day. I was worried at first that I'd miss things. I did ... and it was glorious.

I missed conversations on discord with my friends, then caught back up on my own time. I missed emails by the hundreds so I scheduled in two daily time blocks to go through emails - on my own terms. I missed calls from my girlfriend ... so I set iOS to make it so that her calls specifically gave me notifications and weren't silent.

See, there's a middle-ground. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. I want to focus and have control over my attention and time, most of the time. But there are some circumstances in which I want to be "distracted" and you may too. 

I want my partner to be able to reach me regardless of what I'm doing. Being completely unreachable isn't a luxury most of us can afford, however we can limit who can reach us and when to varying extents.

As an exercise, I recommend going through your installed apps and your contact list to decide which of them really need the ability to notify you and which can wait for you to go check on them.

Reclaiming your attention is not all or nothing. You can claw back your moments wherever it works for you.

#### Uninstall
Some things don't need to be on your phone. As a computer science student, I have a lot of devices. This affords me some separation of responsibility between devices.

I made the decision that, on the rare occasion I need to be on social media, I can do that from my laptop. Same with discord, whatsapp, and other messaging platforms except for the basic call and text.

One nice thing about this is, the browser views of instagram and reddit are less enjoyable to use and seem to have less algorithmically assigned content for you. This makes it a lot easier to avoid doom-scrolling.

This does pose some inconveniences but they're well worth it for me.
#### Grey-scale and low power mode

Two more settings that make your phone less fun to use are setting it to black and white, and setting it to low power mode. 

In the accessibility settings, you can add a colour filter - I chose gray-scale. Surprisingly, this had a massive impact on my phone usage. It's just so boring to look at that I get in and get out now. The vibrant speedy screen is such a joy to use that it sucks me in - replacing it (without physically replacing it) with a dull, grey, slow



### Intervening when Will Fails: One sec

One Sec is FANTASTIC.




### Replacing

Embracing boredom sucks. It's one of those things that takes willpower which.
