      <title>Lifeandlab4: Why I started writing about Homelabbing</title>

      <description>Hey Friends,&#xA;For a long time, I thought that a career in tech meant software development and probably webdev or ML at that. This is comically short sighted especially, given that my father works in IT and that&amp;rsquo;s how I became interested in tech in the first place. Still, there was something about my undergraduate experience that led me to believe, you either became a software developer, or you went into academia.</description>

      <description>Growing up, I was much more into Call of Duty than reading which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard is equally valid and useful to you later in life so shut up. Luckily for me, at some point Call of Duty began to suck and I started a masters degree that forced me to read. Naturally, as a 22/23 year old who was vaguely into tech and productivity, when prompted with the query &amp;ldquo;how read book tech?</description>

      <description>I can dance if I want to&#xA;I don‚Äôt dance. Never have. And i‚Äôm adamant that I can‚Äôt.&#xA;To no fault of my loving and accepting parents, I grew up a little repressed.&#xA;Some people refer to it as ‚ÄúGifted Kid‚Äù syndrome. Personally, I was never given the title but I over-achieved and felt that paralyzing need to be correct - more than any authority figure could ever place on me.</description>

      <title>ABScribe: Rapid Exploration of Multiple Writing Variations in Human-AI Co-Writing Tasks using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://nathanlaundry.com/publications/abscribe/</link>

      <description>Accepted at CHI 2024&#xA;Pre-Print&#xA;Github: ABScribe&#xA;Abstract Exploring alternative ideas by rewriting text is integral to the writing process. State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can simplify writing variation generation. However, current interfaces pose challenges for simultaneous consideration of multiple variations: creating new versions without overwriting text can be difficult, and pasting them sequentially can clutter documents, increasing workload and disrupting writers&amp;rsquo; flow. To tackle this, we present ABScribe, an interface that supports rapid, yet visually structured, exploration of writing variations in human-AI co-writing tasks.</description>

      <description>I heard once, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the comforts that make us feel numb&amp;rdquo; - Hozier&#xA;And you know what? I think he&amp;rsquo;s right.&#xA;I think the ways in which we save time, the little eases and comforts, the ergonomics of our lives numb us and erode our sense of meaning. Now, does that mean I churn my own butter and sew my own clothes? Of course not, but it does make me think about the little moments that make up my life and how they make up my sense of meaning.</description>

      <description>Between 33% and 46% of Ph.D. Students don‚Äôt complete their degree [1].&#xA;I don‚Äôt know about you, but that sends shivers down my spine.

While most agree on the big things: write consistently, learn by doing, don‚Äôt aim too high or low, a major point of contention was time management.</description>

      <description>Link Here&#xA;Abstract and Intro STEM learners often find benefit from interactive resources that provide a tutorial-like environment that facilitate guided practice. However, such resources are frequently expensive, and learners are not permitted to retain permanent copies. Online interactive resources are often not completely aligned with the learning outcomes for a class. Instructors may adopt more than one resource to provide a complete set of materials for students, which can increase both the financial burden and the cognitive load for students who must then pay for access to multiple resources and remember which resource to use in each context.</description>

      <description>Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis&#xA;PDF: [Toward a Computational Thinking Paradigm](Designing, Deploying, and Analyzing Adaptive Educational Field Experiments)&#xA;Abstract Computational Thinking (CT) is crucial in today‚Äôs world, but the lack of a shared paradigm poses challenges for researchers addressing key issues like effective teaching. Diverse stakeholder motivations further complicate consensus on definitions, methods, and metrics. This research proposes a CT meta-framework, integrating cognitive science and stakeholder hypotheses, to disambiguate definitions and clarify experimental methods for a CT transfer experiment.</description>

      <description>Submitted to EduCHI-2023&#xA;Find it Here: PDF&#xA;Abstract This paper explores the use of A/B testing as a pedagogical tool&#xA;for iterative design in HCI classrooms and outlines a vision for&#xA;experiment-inspired design. The traditional focus on the statistical&#xA;aspects of A/B testing education has meant that the equally crucial&#xA;role of iterative design embedded within the experimental process&#xA;has not received commensurate attention. By incorporating iter-&#xA;ative design learning activities that are scaffolded by A/B testing</description>

      <description>What you‚Äôll find here&#xA;My process for figuring out what to include in a literature review The template I built for writing future literature reviews So recently I had to write a literature review for one of my classes and I wanted to formalize my approach to doing so. I‚Äôve been working on it for the past few days and thought I‚Äôd share what I‚Äôve done so any new graduate students, like myself, can learn from it and hopefully share their own tips and tricks.</description>

      <description>üëã Hey Friends, So, I‚Äôve decided to try to write more short articles. I‚Äôve realized that my perfectionist tendencies have crept in once again and are keeping me from posting more frequently. I‚Äôve got a backlog of ideas that I keep tinkering with hoping one day they‚Äôll be good enough to share. This little article is the first in an attempt to share the imperfect. Here‚Äôs a little idea I had on walks and how they facilitate thinking.</description>

      <title>Building Online Gaming Communities: From Features to Emergent Behaviours to Online Communities</title>

      <description>Unpublished PDF Available here&#xA;Abstract Players form meaningful communities via online games. Game developers can retain players if they support online communities.&#xA;However, existing literature often does not provide actionable advice on how to build online communities and insights gathered&#xA;may only be relevant for one game or one genre of games. Through consolidating existing literature, we found that it may be the&#xA;behaviours that emerged (Emergent Behaviours) that create online communities.</description>

      <title>Code Smells as a Framework for Automated Feedback for Novice Programmers - ICERI2021</title>

      <description>[Full Paper Here](https://library.iated.org/view/LAUNDRY2021COD) Abstract Students who receive high quality, rapid feedback about their work are advantaged. The absence of feedback within a reasonable timeline can reinforce incorrect learning, instigate student frustration, and ultimately lead to student disengagement. Automated feedback has been shown to be an effective tool that can scale easily to large class sizes and has positive impacts on student learning. Existing feedback mechanisms for computer programmers such as messages produced by compilers and linters are cryptic and not aimed at novice coders.</description>

      <description>SIGCSE 2023&#xA;LINK: Designing, Deploying, and Analyzing Adaptive Educational Field Experiments&#xA;Abstract Digital experiments can be used in CSedu to test hypotheses about interventions and conditions&amp;rsquo; efficacy (or inefficacy). This workshop will discuss and deconstruct the design process and analysis for various experiments conducted in CS1. E.g., experiments testing which explanations students find helpful, which emails get them to start homework early, or which webpages effectively encourage and motivate students.</description>
