        <h3>Why is your website so plain???</h3>
        <p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
        <p>I tried making it pretty before. I think I even succeeded. But, I spent so much time messing with CSS and making this fragile mess of code that I never actually wrote anything. So, I'm going to keep it ugly and actually write stuff this time ... I Hope.</p>

		<p>Growing up, I was much more into Call of Duty than reading which I&rsquo;ve heard is equally valid and useful to you later in life so shut up.<br>
Luckily for me, at some point Call of Duty began to suck and I started a masters degree that forced me to read. Naturally, as a 22/23 year old who was vaguely<br>
into tech and productivity, when prompted with the query &ldquo;how read book tech?&rdquo; the brilliance of the youtube algorithm recommended me an Ali Abdaal video on Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle.</p>

<p>I can dance if I want to</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt dance. Never have. And i‚Äôm adamant that I can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>To no fault of my loving and accepting parents, I grew up a little repressed.</p>
<p>Some people refer to it as ‚ÄúGifted Kid‚Äù syndrome. Personally, I was never given the title but I over-achieved and felt that paralyzing need to be correct - more than any authority figure could ever place on me. Even at that young age the need to be perfect had settled deep in my bones. And what does one do when their need to be perfect cannot be assuaged? They simply do not act at all.</p>

<p>Accepted at CHI 2024<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00117">Pre-Print</a><br>
Github: <a href="">ABScribe</a></p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Exploring alternative ideas by rewriting text is integral to the writing process. State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can simplify writing variation generation. However, current interfaces pose challenges for simultaneous consideration of multiple variations: creating new versions without overwriting text can be difficult, and pasting them sequentially can clutter documents, increasing workload and disrupting writers&rsquo; flow. To tackle this, we present ABScribe, an interface that supports rapid, yet visually structured, exploration of writing variations in human-AI co-writing tasks. With ABScribe, users can swiftly produce multiple variations using LLM prompts, which are auto-converted into reusable buttons. Variations are stored adjacently within text segments for rapid in-place comparisons using mouse-over interactions on a context toolbar. Our user study with 12 writers shows that ABScribe significantly reduces task workload (d = 1.20, p &lt; 0.001), enhances user perceptions of the revision process (d = 2.41, p &lt; 0.001) compared to a popular baseline workflow, and provides insights into how writers explore variations using LLMs.</p>

<p>I heard once, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the comforts that make us feel numb&rdquo; - Hozier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you know what? I think he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think the ways in which we save time, the little eases and comforts, the ergonomics of our lives numb us and erode our sense of meaning. Now, does that mean I churn my own butter and sew my own clothes? Of course not, but it does make me think about the little moments that make up my life and how they make up my sense of meaning.</p>
