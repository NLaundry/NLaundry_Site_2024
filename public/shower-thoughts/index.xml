      <description>Growing up, I was much more into Call of Duty than reading which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard is equally valid and useful to you later in life so shut up. Luckily for me, at some point Call of Duty began to suck and I started a masters degree that forced me to read. Naturally, as a 22/23 year old who was vaguely into tech and productivity, when prompted with the query &amp;ldquo;how read book tech?</description>

      <title>The Point of Dance</title>

      <description>I can dance if I want to&#xA;I don‚Äôt dance. Never have. And i‚Äôm adamant that I can‚Äôt.&#xA;To no fault of my loving and accepting parents, I grew up a little repressed.&#xA;Some people refer to it as ‚ÄúGifted Kid‚Äù syndrome. Personally, I was never given the title but I over-achieved and felt that paralyzing need to be correct - more than any authority figure could ever place on me.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s the Comforts That Make us Feel Numb.</title>

      <description>I heard once, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the comforts that make us feel numb&amp;rdquo; - Hozier&#xA;And you know what? I think he&amp;rsquo;s right.&#xA;I think the ways in which we save time, the little eases and comforts, the ergonomics of our lives numb us and erode our sense of meaning. Now, does that mean I churn my own butter and sew my own clothes? Of course not, but it does make me think about the little moments that make up my life and how they make up my sense of meaning.</description>

      <description>Stop Trying to Remember Everything you Read. The Having vs Being fallacy of digital second brains and remembering everything you¬†read I was seduced by the Capture Everything, Remember Everything you read, Digital Brain, trend for 2 years. You know what it got me? A Notion AND Roam Research so full I&amp;rsquo;m terrified of looking through them and a long list of books I&amp;rsquo;ve speed read but can barely recall.</description>

      <description>üëã Hey Friends, Getting into a new field of research requires reading dozens of landmark and seminal papers to understand that field‚Äôs foundations. This usually involves the manual process of searching key-words on google scholar, finding papers, polling friends, advisors, colleagues, and other experts for the most important papers. It‚Äôs an ad-hoc process that can take months.&#xA;Even more time intensive is conducting a proper, methodical, literature review. Establishing a method, identifying the correct keywords, finding the right databases - it‚Äôs difficult but vital work.</description>

      <description>üí°If you want to learn French, move to France.&#xA;üßë‚Äçüíª How I Learned Terminal Driven Linux This is my mantra and it all started in 2016, my first year as a Computer Science Undergrad at the University of Guelph. I had been looped in by SOCIS ‚Äî the Society of Computing and Information Sciences ‚Äî which sounds a lot more official than it really was. At the time, it was a small community of fellow geeks, nerds, and tech enthusiasts (it‚Äôs grown to be much larger than that these days) and the cool thing was Linux.</description>

      <description>üëã Hey Friends, Some kids grow up wanting to be firefighters, astronauts, or teachers ‚Ä¶ I wanted to be Laplace‚Äôs Demon. Let me explain.&#xA;Pierre Simon Laplace hypothesized:&#xA;if we knew both the laws of physics and the location of every particle in the universe, we would be able to predict everything that would happen in the future. ‚Äî Paraphrasing Pierre Simon Laplace on Laplace‚Äôs demon&#xA;Laplace attributed these powers to an imagined demon with almost infinite intellect.</description>

      <description>üî• ‚ÄúI hate writing and I never want to do it again.‚Äù ‚Äî Nathan Laundry 2013 to 2020&#xA;And I‚Äôm not alone. In Computer Science a lot of us wear our disdain for writing as a badge of honour. Honestly, there‚Äôs a sense of comradery in our shared hate for writing. I‚Äôd go so far as to say, in the undergrad‚Äôs natural habitat ‚Äî the lecture hall ‚Äî you can identify Computer Science students by the distinct groan they emit when an essay is assigned.</description>

      <description>Between 33% and 46% of Ph.D. Students don‚Äôt complete their degree [1].&#xA;I don‚Äôt know about you, but that sends shivers down my spine. In my reading and previous article on how to succeed with one‚Äôs doctoral pursuits, we discussed the many ways that professors have seen graduate students fail to finish their degrees. While most agree on the big things: write consistently, learn by doing, don‚Äôt aim too high or low, a major point of contention was time management.</description>

      <description>What you‚Äôll find here&#xA;My process for figuring out what to include in a literature review The template I built for writing future literature reviews So recently I had to write a literature review for one of my classes and I wanted to formalize my approach to doing so. I‚Äôve been working on it for the past few days and thought I‚Äôd share what I‚Äôve done so any new graduate students, like myself, can learn from it and hopefully share their own tips and tricks.</description>

      <description>üëã Hey Friends, So, I‚Äôve decided to try to write more short articles. I‚Äôve realized that my perfectionist tendencies have crept in once again and are keeping me from posting more frequently. I‚Äôve got a backlog of ideas that I keep tinkering with hoping one day they‚Äôll be good enough to share. This little article is the first in an attempt to share the imperfect. Here‚Äôs a little idea I had on walks and how they facilitate thinking.</description>
