        <p>Hi, I'm Nathan. I'm a Computer Science PhD student with two passions: homelab, and self-improvement. I write about both and some other stuff:</p>

                and personal insights on self-improvement.</li>
            <li><a href="shower-thoughts">Shower Thoughts:</a> This is where I jam anything I'm thinking about. Often
                slow productivity and trying to find some meaning in the 21st century.</li>

		üèÉüèΩ TLDR ‚Äî How to find summer research opportunities and freelance programming jobs for undergraduates There is a huge unfulfilled need for programmers outside of the tech-sphere both in research and in industry
How to find research and freelance opportunities outside of the usual places:
Go to events and join clubs
Teach, tutor, and be taught
Say yes to opportunities wherever you find them
Opportunities to look out for:
Data is plentiful and in need of analysis.

		Hi! I‚Äôm Nathan. Hope this little Grad School Survival guide helps :)
Check out my other work at Nathanlaundry.com
The TLDR on how to survive your master‚Äôs/phd
Priortize your research, not your grades Listen to your advisors but know when to take the lead Don‚Äôt read too much (there is a sweet spot) Learn by problem-solving Don‚Äôt leave all your writing to the end As I approach the end of my first year as a graduate student, I‚Äôve begun to look forward; crafting a path towards a successful thesis and setting up for my PhD.

Description This resource is part of an investigation into a semi-automated process for creating Self-Contained, Interactive Open Educational Resources (SCIOER) for use by students and instructors in the discipline of Computer Science. Resources created through the SCIOER process are self-contained and provide all the tools necessary for learners. The interactive nature of the resource encourages experimentation and incremental practice. Learners are able to annotate SCIOER resources with their personal observations and learnings.

		Ocean Eyes i‚Äôd remake the world in your image
so the poets and bards of time
would sing and marvel
of liquid hazel shores
and rich mahogany skies
brilliantly painted
like those eyes of yours
What if? Say the word
and i will scorch the valleys
and salt the fields
of regret
You and i
have no time or need
for the blooming melancholy
the seeds of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù

		This is a two parter - Return and Scorched Earth The first depicts the terrible calm of a relapse into depression The second is how it feels to weaponize anger to claw oneself out of depression If I&rsquo;m being honest, I think the second part is the better of the two lol
## Return --- Welcome Home No one warns you
How warmly she welcomes you
How comforting and sober she sounds

		Altar Salt my skin
and soak my flesh
These words are the altar
upon which
I sacrifice myself
Burning
and Proud
Helen You‚Äôre divinity
wrapped in the Old God‚Äôs best imitation
of mortal flesh
Your name - both spark and fan
to the desires
and ires
of men
And though Troy‚Äôs walls
are long since fell
Homer could scrawl the same ink
recounting the battles
that rage over you

		Entrancing There‚Äôs music in your voice
rhythm in your body
and an elegant chaos in your mind
I can‚Äôt imagine
anything more entrancing
than you
with a story to tell
Books if not your mind
I shall read your books.
I‚Äôll live in the stories that crafted you
Breathe in the fiction that forged your reality
Assembling within me, your visage
Character by character
Line by line
Word by word

		Too Much I learned to love
like everything is on the verge of ending.
Forgive me if I take too much today
Forgive me if I need you to remind me
you‚Äôll be here tomorrow.
Power The greatest lie I ever told myself
is that I chose
to give you the power
to ruin me
Search Today I searched you up again.
Sometimes when I‚Äôm lonely
I find an unsettling comfort
