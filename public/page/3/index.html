            <li><a href="lifeandlab">Life and Lab:</a> My weekly newsletter. A mix of Unixy things I learned that week
                and personal insights on self-improvement.</li>
            <li><a href="shower-thoughts">Shower Thoughts:</a> This is where I jam anything I'm thinking about. Often
                slow productivity and trying to find some meaning in the 21st century.</li>

Description This resource is part of an investigation into a semi-automated process for creating Self-Contained, Interactive Open Educational Resources (SCIOER) for use by students and instructors in the discipline of Computer Science. Resources created through the SCIOER process are self-contained and provide all the tools necessary for learners. The interactive nature of the resource encourages experimentation and incremental practice. Learners are able to annotate SCIOER resources with their personal observations and learnings.

		Ocean Eyes i’d remake the world in your image
so the poets and bards of time
would sing and marvel
of liquid hazel shores
and rich mahogany skies
brilliantly painted
like those eyes of yours
What if? Say the word
and i will scorch the valleys
and salt the fields
of regret
You and i
have no time or need
for the blooming melancholy
the seeds of “what if”

		This is a two parter - Return and Scorched Earth The first depicts the terrible calm of a relapse into depression The second is how it feels to weaponize anger to claw oneself out of depression If I&rsquo;m being honest, I think the second part is the better of the two lol
## Return --- Welcome Home No one warns you
How warmly she welcomes you
How comforting and sober she sounds

		Altar Salt my skin
and soak my flesh
These words are the altar
upon which
I sacrifice myself
Burning
and Proud
Helen You’re divinity
wrapped in the Old God’s best imitation
of mortal flesh
Your name - both spark and fan
to the desires
and ires
of men
And though Troy’s walls
are long since fell
Homer could scrawl the same ink
recounting the battles
that rage over you

		Entrancing There’s music in your voice
rhythm in your body
and an elegant chaos in your mind
I can’t imagine
anything more entrancing
than you
with a story to tell
Books if not your mind
I shall read your books.
I’ll live in the stories that crafted you
Breathe in the fiction that forged your reality
Assembling within me, your visage
Character by character
Line by line
Word by word

		Too Much I learned to love
like everything is on the verge of ending.
Forgive me if I take too much today
Forgive me if I need you to remind me
you’ll be here tomorrow.
Power The greatest lie I ever told myself
is that I chose
to give you the power
to ruin me
Search Today I searched you up again.
Sometimes when I’m lonely
I find an unsettling comfort

		Sparks Without you
I’m like
Flint
Without the Steel
No sparks
Listen I listen to you
like the world is running out of words
and you’re its final act
Breathe The taste of your words
lingers on the air you breathe
and I can’t help but think
how lucky I would be
to breathe that same air
and press upon my lips
those echoes
of you
Stare Brand me with your stare

		Burn The sun and all its siblings
could fair no better
in the gruesome work
of burning my soul
than the friction
between our hearts
as yours
is torn
from mine
Duty of Care To have failed so
in my duty of care
in my guardianship of your heart
I bear this penance
of solitude
to feel your pain as my own
with no solace
of companionship
nor numbing agent
