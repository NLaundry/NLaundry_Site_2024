        <h3>Why is your website so plain???</h3>
        <p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
        <p>I tried making it pretty before. I think I even succeeded. But, I spent so much time messing with CSS and making this fragile mess of code that I never actually wrote anything. So, I'm going to keep it ugly and actually write stuff this time ... I Hope.</p>

		In my Blood A short series of poems dedicated to my grandparents
Grandma Sometimes I wonder
who you see
when you look at me.
Is that love in your eyes
or what remains of your kindness?
Does the heart recall
what the mind does not?
Grandpa When your eyes grow heavy
and you tire of the pain
weâ€™ll find the strength together
to carry our name

		[Full Paper Here](https://library.iated.org/view/LAUNDRY2021COD) Abstract Students who receive high quality, rapid feedback about their work are advantaged. The absence of feedback within a reasonable timeline can reinforce incorrect learning, instigate student frustration, and ultimately lead to student disengagement. Automated feedback has been shown to be an effective tool that can scale easily to large class sizes and has positive impacts on student learning. Existing feedback mechanisms for computer programmers such as messages produced by compilers and linters are cryptic and not aimed at novice coders.

LINK: Designing, Deploying, and Analyzing Adaptive Educational Field Experiments
Abstract Digital experiments can be used in CSedu to test hypotheses about interventions and conditions&rsquo; efficacy (or inefficacy). This workshop will discuss and deconstruct the design process and analysis for various experiments conducted in CS1. E.g., experiments testing which explanations students find helpful, which emails get them to start homework early, or which webpages effectively encourage and motivate students.
