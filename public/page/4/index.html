<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper explores the use of A/B testing as a pedagogical tool<br>
for iterative design in HCI classrooms and outlines a vision for<br>
experiment-inspired design. The traditional focus on the statistical<br>
aspects of A/B testing education has meant that the equally crucial<br>
role of iterative design embedded within the experimental process<br>
has not received commensurate attention. By incorporating iter-<br>
ative design learning activities that are scaffolded by A/B testing<br>
tools, HCI students can gain transferable skills and experience in do-<br>
ing multiple cycles of ideation, prototyping, testing, and evaluation,<br>
and simultaneously contribute to continual course improvement.<br>
We reconsider the role of experimentation in HCI education as<br>
a means for exploring complex design spaces. Drawing from our<br>
experience in teaching this approach and conducting education<br>
research involving sequences of online controlled experiments, we<br>
present examples of how to use A/B testing as a pedagogical tool<br>
for iterative design in HCI classrooms</p>

<li>My process for figuring out what to include in a literature review</li>

</ul>
<p>So recently I had to write a literature review for one of my classes and I wanted to formalize my approach to doing so. Iâ€™ve been working on it for the past few days and thought Iâ€™d share what Iâ€™ve done so any new graduate students, like myself, can learn from it and hopefully share their own tips and tricks.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™ve decided to try to write more short articles. Iâ€™ve realized that my perfectionist tendencies have crept in once again and are keeping me from posting more frequently. Iâ€™ve got a backlog of ideas that I keep tinkering with hoping one day theyâ€™ll be good enough to share. This little article is the first in an attempt to share the imperfect. Hereâ€™s a little idea I had on walks and how they facilitate thinking.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Players form meaningful communities via online games. Game developers can retain players if they support online communities.<br>
However, existing literature often does not provide actionable advice on how to build online communities and insights gathered<br>
may only be relevant for one game or one genre of games. Through consolidating existing literature, we found that it may be the<br>
behaviours that emerged (Emergent Behaviours) that create online communities. To determine if Emergent Behaviours can directly<br>
lead to online gaming communities, we conducted seven semi-structured online interviews with players of World of Warcraft and<br>
StarCraft. Our interviews revealed seven Emergent Behaviours that can help form online gaming communities and the 13 Feature<br>
Categories (with example features) developers can build to foster the Emergent Behaviours in their games</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Students who receive high quality, rapid feedback about their work are advantaged. The absence of feedback within a reasonable timeline can reinforce incorrect learning, instigate student frustration, and ultimately lead to student disengagement. Automated feedback has been shown to be an effective tool that can scale easily to large class sizes and has positive impacts on student learning. Existing feedback mechanisms for computer programmers such as messages produced by compilers and linters are cryptic and not aimed at novice coders. Furthermore, these existing tools do not attempt to address programming design issues, rather they simply point out a potential error in the code without explantion about why the error is problematic or what the underlying misconception might be.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Digital experiments can be used in CSedu to test hypotheses about interventions and conditions&rsquo; efficacy (or inefficacy). This workshop will discuss and deconstruct the design process and analysis for various experiments conducted in CS1. E.g., experiments testing which explanations students find helpful, which emails get them to start homework early, or which webpages effectively encourage and motivate students. This workshop teaches participants how to conduct, interpret, and analyze adaptive field experiments. These adaptive experiments employ machine learning algorithms to analyze experiments during deployment and dynamically shift the allocation of arms/conditions to give future students better conditions more rapidly. Adaptive field experiments can accelerate scientific discovery by enabling more complex experimental designs and increasing statistical power by phasing conditions in and out more efficiently. The workshop is supported by a 5-year NSF grant to build software tools and a digital community, gathering instructors, domain scientists and methodologists to teach them how to run adaptive experiments. The methodological focus includes understanding: (1) which algorithms are best for adaptive experiments that meet domain scientists&rsquo; needs in specific experimental designs and data sets; (2) which hypothesis tests and Bayesian analyses to choose. Software companies use these innovative methodologies extensively to continuously improve product design. This workshop demonstrates how the same methods can be used in CSedu to improve research rigor and accelerate educational research implementation, ultimately improving student outcomes.</p>
