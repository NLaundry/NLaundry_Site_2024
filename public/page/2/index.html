        <p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
        <p>I tried making it pretty before. I think I even succeeded. But, I spent so much time messing with CSS and making this fragile mess of code that I never actually wrote anything. So, I'm going to keep it ugly and actually write stuff this time ... I Hope.</p>

<p>Some kids grow up wanting to be firefighters, astronauts, or teachers … I wanted to be Laplace’s Demon. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Pierre Simon Laplace hypothesized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if we knew both the laws of physics and the location of every particle in the universe, we would be able to predict everything that would happen in the future. — Paraphrasing Pierre Simon Laplace on Laplace’s demon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laplace attributed these powers to an imagined demon with almost infinite intellect. That’s what I wanted to be. Oh the ego on that kid.</p>

<p>And I’m not alone. In Computer Science a lot of us wear our disdain for writing as a badge of honour. Honestly, there’s a sense of comradery in our shared hate for writing. I’d go so far as to say, in the undergrad’s natural habitat — the lecture hall — you can identify Computer Science students by the distinct groan they emit when an essay is assigned.</p>

<p>We’ve all read enough “Covid sucks and here’s why” articles. So for both your and my sanity, I’m going to keep that discussion to a minimum. Instead, I’m going to focus on the Canadian Computer Science community and the broader new graduate student research community. Two events near and dear to my heart have either not been run since the start of COVID or have gone completely virtual and lost major attendance: CUSEC and CSGames.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but that sends shivers down my spine. In my reading and previous article on how to succeed with one’s doctoral pursuits, we discussed the many ways that professors have seen graduate students fail to finish their degrees. While most agree on the big things: write consistently, learn by doing, don’t aim too high or low, a major point of contention was time management. The cornerstone argument: does a 9–5 schedule work for a Ph.D. Some claim the doctoral pursuit requires zealous around-the-clock devotion, while others assert that the 9–5 gives you the rigour and structure you’ll need to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-and-intro">Abstract and Intro</h2>
<p>STEM learners often find benefit from interactive resources that provide a tutorial-like environment that facilitate guided practice. However, such resources are frequently expensive, and learners are not permitted to retain permanent copies. Online interactive resources are often not completely aligned with the learning outcomes for a class. Instructors may adopt more than one resource to provide a complete set of materials for students, which can increase both the financial burden and the cognitive load for students who must then pay for access to multiple resources and remember which resource to use in each context. Additionally, most interactive resources require the learner to maintain a high-speed network connection to the resource. For learners in rural or remote areas, a high-speed internet requirement might be impossible to meet.</p>

<p>Master&rsquo;s Thesis<br>
PDF: [Toward a Computational Thinking Paradigm](Designing, Deploying, and Analyzing Adaptive Educational Field Experiments)</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Computational Thinking (CT) is crucial in today’s world, but the lack of a shared paradigm poses challenges for researchers addressing key issues like effective teaching. Diverse stakeholder motivations further complicate consensus on definitions, methods, and metrics. This research proposes a CT meta-framework, integrating cognitive science and stakeholder hypotheses, to disambiguate definitions and clarify experimental methods for a CT transfer experiment. The framework’s success is measured by its ability to disambiguate transfer and algorithm definitions, determine an algorithmic thinking metric, and design a transfer case study method. The research involves three steps: 1) literature review and coding to identify CT per- spectives and provide nomenclature for them; 2) integrating cognitive science concepts to develop the CT meta-framework; and 3) applying the meta-framework in a transfer case study to disambiguate definitions and identify limitations. This research aims to bridge the gap between CT perspectives and facilitate a more cohesive approach to CT research and education.</p>

<p>There is a huge unfulfilled need for programmers outside of the tech-sphere both in research and in industry<br>
How to find research and freelance opportunities outside of the usual places:<br>
Go to events and join clubs<br>
Teach, tutor, and be taught<br>
Say yes to opportunities wherever you find them<br>
Opportunities to look out for:<br>
Data is plentiful and in need of analysis. Improving data management and providing insights to companies is extremely valuable<br>
Interdisciplinary research — a lot of research requires a programming aspect these days, offer your services</p>

		<p>Hi! I’m Nathan. Hope this little Grad School Survival guide helps :)</p>
<p>Check out my other work at Nathanlaundry.com<br>
The TLDR on how to survive your master’s/phd</p>
<pre><code>Priortize your research, not your grades
Listen to your advisors but know when to take the lead
Don’t read too much (there is a sweet spot)
Learn by problem-solving
Don’t leave all your writing to the end
</code></pre>
<p>As I approach the end of my first year as a graduate student, I’ve begun to look forward; crafting a path towards a successful thesis and setting up for my PhD. The thing about this kind of reflection is it brings about some alarming realizations. Some of those realizations include: “oh dear lord, I don’t know what I’m doing”, “what the heck do I do next?”, and “I don’t even know, what I don’t know.” To remedy this situation, I’ve done what any good academic would do — research.</p>
