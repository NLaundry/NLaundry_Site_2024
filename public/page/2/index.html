        <h3>Why is your website so plain???</h3>
        <p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
        <p>I tried making it pretty before. I think I even succeeded. But, I spent so much time messing with CSS and making this fragile mess of code that I never actually wrote anything. So, I'm going to keep it ugly and actually write stuff this time ... I Hope.</p>

		👋 Hey Friends, Some kids grow up wanting to be firefighters, astronauts, or teachers … I wanted to be Laplace’s Demon. Let me explain.
Pierre Simon Laplace hypothesized:
if we knew both the laws of physics and the location of every particle in the universe, we would be able to predict everything that would happen in the future. — Paraphrasing Pierre Simon Laplace on Laplace’s demon
Laplace attributed these powers to an imagined demon with almost infinite intellect.

		🔥 “I hate writing and I never want to do it again.” — Nathan Laundry 2013 to 2020
And I’m not alone. In Computer Science a lot of us wear our disdain for writing as a badge of honour. Honestly, there’s a sense of comradery in our shared hate for writing. I’d go so far as to say, in the undergrad’s natural habitat — the lecture hall — you can identify Computer Science students by the distinct groan they emit when an essay is assigned.

		Between 33% and 46% of Ph.D. Students don’t complete their degree [1].
I don’t know about you, but that sends shivers down my spine. In my reading and previous article on how to succeed with one’s doctoral pursuits, we discussed the many ways that professors have seen graduate students fail to finish their degrees. While most agree on the big things: write consistently, learn by doing, don’t aim too high or low, a major point of contention was time management.

		Master&rsquo;s Thesis
PDF: [Toward a Computational Thinking Paradigm](Designing, Deploying, and Analyzing Adaptive Educational Field Experiments)
Abstract Computational Thinking (CT) is crucial in today’s world, but the lack of a shared paradigm poses challenges for researchers addressing key issues like effective teaching. Diverse stakeholder motivations further complicate consensus on definitions, methods, and metrics. This research proposes a CT meta-framework, integrating cognitive science and stakeholder hypotheses, to disambiguate definitions and clarify experimental methods for a CT transfer experiment.

		🏃🏽 TLDR — How to find summer research opportunities and freelance programming jobs for undergraduates There is a huge unfulfilled need for programmers outside of the tech-sphere both in research and in industry
How to find research and freelance opportunities outside of the usual places:
Go to events and join clubs
Teach, tutor, and be taught
Say yes to opportunities wherever you find them
Opportunities to look out for:
Data is plentiful and in need of analysis.

		Hi! I’m Nathan. Hope this little Grad School Survival guide helps :)
Check out my other work at Nathanlaundry.com
The TLDR on how to survive your master’s/phd
Priortize your research, not your grades Listen to your advisors but know when to take the lead Don’t read too much (there is a sweet spot) Learn by problem-solving Don’t leave all your writing to the end As I approach the end of my first year as a graduate student, I’ve begun to look forward; crafting a path towards a successful thesis and setting up for my PhD.

		Ocean Eyes i’d remake the world in your image
so the poets and bards of time
would sing and marvel
of liquid hazel shores
and rich mahogany skies
brilliantly painted
like those eyes of yours
What if? Say the word
and i will scorch the valleys
and salt the fields
of regret
You and i
have no time or need
for the blooming melancholy
the seeds of “what if”
