      <description>üí° Truly great writing, the kind that moves us, comes from lived human experiences. This will always be the domain of Sapiens. ‚Äî A trust me bro statement by Nathan Laundry&#xA;ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt have its own stories to share, but it excels at finding mistakes in the ways I write about mine! That‚Äôs why ChatGPT and I make a great team. I bring real stories and ChatGPT helps me convey them effectively.</description>

      <description>üî• ‚ÄúI hate writing and I never want to do it again.‚Äù ‚Äî Nathan Laundry 2013 to 2020&#xA;And I‚Äôm not alone. In Computer Science a lot of us wear our disdain for writing as a badge of honour. Honestly, there‚Äôs a sense of comradery in our shared hate for writing. I‚Äôd go so far as to say, in the undergrad‚Äôs natural habitat ‚Äî the lecture hall ‚Äî you can identify Computer Science students by the distinct groan they emit when an essay is assigned.</description>

      <description>Hi! I‚Äôm Nathan. Hope this little Grad School Survival guide helps :)&#xA;Check out my other work at Nathanlaundry.com&#xA;The TLDR on how to survive your master‚Äôs/phd&#xA;Priortize your research, not your grades Listen to your advisors but know when to take the lead Don‚Äôt read too much (there is a sweet spot) Learn by problem-solving Don‚Äôt leave all your writing to the end As I approach the end of my first year as a graduate student, I‚Äôve begun to look forward; crafting a path towards a successful thesis and setting up for my PhD.</description>

      <description>What you‚Äôll find here&#xA;My process for figuring out what to include in a literature review The template I built for writing future literature reviews So recently I had to write a literature review for one of my classes and I wanted to formalize my approach to doing so. I‚Äôve been working on it for the past few days and thought I‚Äôd share what I‚Äôve done so any new graduate students, like myself, can learn from it and hopefully share their own tips and tricks.</description>
