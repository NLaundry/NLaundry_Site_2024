      <description>🔥 “I hate writing and I never want to do it again.” — Nathan Laundry 2013 to 2020&#xA;And I’m not alone.

      <description>Hi! I’m Nathan. Hope this little Grad School Survival guide helps :)&#xA;Check out my other work at Nathanlaundry.com&#xA;The TLDR on how to survive your master’s/phd&#xA;Priortize your research, not your grades Listen to your advisors but know when to take the lead Don’t read too much (there is a sweet spot) Learn by problem-solving Don’t leave all your writing to the end As I approach the end of my first year as a graduate student, I’ve begun to look forward; crafting a path towards a successful thesis and setting up for my PhD.</description>

I’ve been working on it for the past few days and thought I’d share what I’ve done so any new graduate students, like myself, can learn from it and hopefully share their own tips and tricks.</description>
