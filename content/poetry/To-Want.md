<br/>

## Ocean Eyes

i’d remake the world in your image

so the poets and bards of time

would sing and marvel

of liquid hazel shores

and rich mahogany skies

brilliantly painted

like those eyes of yours


<br/>

## What if?

Say the word

and i will scorch the valleys

and salt the fields

of regret

<br/> 

You and i

have no time or need

for the blooming melancholy

the seeds of “what if”

become


<br/>

## Eve

On first sight of you

I learned

what it was for Eve

to break the skin of knowing

to be reanimated

ripe with nascent desire

<br/> 

I had no true knowledge of wanting

until I met you


<br/>

## Hunger

I'm afraid that I hunger for you too much

That if you were mine

And my want of you

Were to be sated

There would be nothing left of yourself

For you


<br/>

## Gravity

I have neither the strength

nor the desire

to cut free 

from the insidious tendrils of hope

you’ve sent for me

<br/> 

Oh, be kind as I fall

for gravity is not
