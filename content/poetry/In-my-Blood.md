# In my Blood

A short series of poems dedicated to my grandparents

## Grandma

Sometimes I wonder
who you see
when you look at me.
Is that love in your eyes
or what remains of your kindness?
Does the heart recall
what the mind does not?

## Grandpa

When your eyes grow heavy
and you tire of the pain
weâ€™ll find the strength together
to carry our name
