## Entrancing

There’s music in your voice

rhythm in your body

and an elegant chaos in your mind

<br/>

I can’t imagine

anything more entrancing

than you

with a story to tell

<br/>

## Books

if not your mind

I shall read your books.

I’ll live in the stories that crafted you

Breathe in the fiction that forged your reality

<br/>

Assembling within me, your visage

Character by character

Line by line

Word by word

<br/>

## Unshackled

What must you be - I wonder

to command my every waking thought

to invade the solace of my dreams

to dine

on the agonizing yearning

you’ve manifested in me?

<br/>

And what must I be

to live to feed you

to pray I’m never unshackled

to be effervescent

in my enthralment?

<br/>

## Urgency

I want you to want me

like the ocean wants the shore

like the moon wants the day

like the Winter wants the Spring’s blooming

<br/>

Thirst for me like oasis just over the horizon

as if I’m all you’ll ever need - just beyond reach

<br/>

Marinate in desolate, immolating desire

so that when our time comes

our love

will taste of the sweetest urgency

<br/>

## Fill


My mind 

enthralled 

an ever playing cinema

of moments passed and yet to be

with a single star - you.

<br/>

My eyes

taste original sin on your skin

your fingers

your collar bone,

betraying eternity

for a single bite of your silhouette

<br/>

My heart

pumps its scarlet soil

in preparation

for every inch of sinew and bone

the garden patchwork of my body

to be fertilized by you

<br/>

your hopes

your gaze

your love
