## Sparks

Without you

I’m like 

Flint

Without the Steel

No sparks

<br/>

## Listen

I listen to you

like the world is running out of words

and you’re its final act

<br/>

## Breathe


The taste of your words

lingers on the air you breathe

and I can’t help but think

how lucky I would be

to breathe that same air

and press upon my lips

those echoes

of you

<br/>

## Stare

Brand me with your stare

let me feel the heat

of you

on every inch of my skin

<br/>

What I wouldn’t give

for you

to claim me

with those electric eyes

<br/>

## Light


Let me feast on your presence

and starve in your absence

bask in your voice

and decay in the silence

confine me to the dark

so that I may truly love

your light

<br/>

## Sharing


I’d strike the weather from your vocabulary

halt the news

pause the world

so all would be void

of any talking point

but you

and the splendours of your mind

<br/>

## Approach

Let me be sleepless in your approach

let the possibility that I may never know you

consume me

fuel me

Let curiosity brew into obsession

want burn within me

until

the anvil beating of my heart

forges want into n eed

Then, and only then

grant me the serenity

of speaking my name

<br/>

## Then

Look at me and see me

Read me and understand me

Participate in me and know me

Then you may say that you’ve loved me
