<br/>
This is a two parter - Return and Scorched Earth
The first depicts the terrible calm of a relapse into depression
The second is how it feels to weaponize anger to claw oneself out of depression

If I'm being honest, I think the second part is the better of the two lol

<br/>
## Return
---

<br/>

###  Welcome Home

No one warns you

How warmly she welcomes you

How comforting and sober she sounds

<br/>

They dont tell you

How confidently she lays claim

To the voice of Reason

How gently she wields it

to suggest 

Maybe Hope

was never part

of the Real You

<br/>

She crafts apathy

from the wonders of the world

weaves calm

Out of the viscous black

<br/>

How terrifyingly peaceful it is

that Depression

feels like coming home

How every time

you wonder

if you’ll ever leave again

<br/>

### Cry Wolf

You never really overcome anxiety

you just learn to doubt yourself

in the most productive way possible

<br/>

the deep breathing never stills your heart

the counting never focuses your mind

death

never stops its teasing

<br/>

You simply learn

that your body

is not to be trusted

when it cries wolf

and you pretend that calm

is a matter of the mind 

alone

<br/>

Still

I’ve always wondered

what I’d do

if the wolf finally came

for that poor

scared

boy

<br/>

### Screaming

Inside me

Every memory

Every emotion

I’ve ever had

is Screaming

all at once

<br/>

>                             Make It Stop

<br/>

It's so loud

<br/>

>                             make it stop

<br/>
There’s no room 

in here

For me

Anymore

<br/>

>                             Make it stop

<br/>

it Burns

<br/>

> make it stop

>   make it stop

>      make it stop
 
<br/>

###  Enough

I need to rest

>                  you haven’t done enough

That’s all I have

>                  it’s not enough

There’s always tomorrow

>                  you’re not enough

I’m trying

>                   Not. Enough.

I’m sorry

> Never Enough
>
> never Enough
>
> never enough

<br/>

### Drive

Make no Mistake

This isn’t Drive

This is Penitence

<br/>

### Strong 

Am I supposed to be grateful

To have endured worse

To know I can?

Just because I can survive this

Doesn't mean I want to.

<br/>

I’ve been fighting

I’ve been strong

for so long

<br/>

and I’m tired

<br/>

What makes rest

so different

from surrender?


<br/>

## Scorched Earth

---

<br/>

### Longer

Hold on

Just a little longer

There's light at the end of this tunnel

<br/>

I know

Because I put it there

The last time I pushed through

<br/>

### Demon

I’ve personified you

given you form and face

for my sake

<br/>

as ether

as void

there is only

how you hurt me

<br/>

as creature

as demon

you can bleed

I can put you to the flames

<br/>

### Reason

While you were away

I hardened my body

with Iron

Nurtured my soul

with Hope

Filled my heart

with Love

<br/>

I gave my life 

Purpose

so that when you came back

to take it

I’d have the weapons to fight

and reason to do so

<br/>

### Parasite

You’re not a part of me

you’re a parasite

and I am not afraid

to burn all of me 

to the ground

to starve you

to smoke you out

of every corner

and crevice

of my mind

<br/>

It was you

who numbed me to the pain

so 

if it’s us together

on the pyre

I will outlive you

<br/>

I will rise from the ashes

Wholly anew

Entirely

Without you

<br/>

### Example

You'll make such a beautiful

Wretched

Example

So the next time

The demons of my mind

Grow bold and stupid 

You can tell them

How strong I've become

How viciously

I will fight

For my life

<br/>

### Sadist

I watched

how you revelled

in my suffering

the despair of a tired, lonely boy

and I learned

your sadism

<br/>

I’ve wasted not an ounce

of hatred

not a drop

of cruelty

I stowed it all away

within myself

for you

for your return

<br/>

Now the bell sounds

for this

our 18th round

<br/>

Hobble back into the ring

to face what you’ve created

nobody is coming to save you

and I’ve grown your taste

for blood

<br/>

### Rite

When the flames

are laid to rest

When this earth is scorched

And cleansed of you

Will I have sacrificed

Too much

at the altar

of Survival?

<br/>

Will I recognize myself

On the other end

Of this pyrrhic rite?

<br/>

Will I want to?

<br/>

### Pity

How does it feel

to fight a battle

in a war

you’ll never win?

To know your greatest days are behind you?

To have lost to a child at your best

and be faced with a man at your worst?

<br/>

I pity you

once my greatest terror

now you languish in my shadow

Even your darkness

falls short of mine

<br/>

So

prepare your tired arms

and spit your petty venom

just make it quick

you’ve nothing new for me

and I’ve got work to do.

<br/>

### Mine

It was a grave mistake

to trespass here

all those years ago

<br/>

You miserable weary thing

you were never meant

to hold these reins

to steer my life

to carve my path

<br/>

This has always been

My Mind

and it answers

Only

To Me
