# Clockwork and Clay


## THRONE

We sired life in bronze and steam and lured in our clockwork Eve

When this the child of man claims its patricidal throne we'll wonder how we failed to learn from the Gods that came before us

## ORCHARDS

Who of us will learn to breathe the smoke and steam that rises form the orchards of Turing's Eden

## OLYMPUS

the flame for us 

the bolt for you

when you've stolen for your children what will be left between their Athens and your Olympus?

## KNOW

We fed the apple to silicon and steel 

What right have we to ask it how it came to know?


## IMAGE

Ichor to iron to oil 

flesh to clay to copper 

what have we lost  

in the image of an image? 

What are you but the shadow of a shadow?

## RELIC

When our promethean pursuit is complete 

and we've fashioned a likeness of our own 

will we be elevated - Man to God? 

will we be relegated - toy to relic?
