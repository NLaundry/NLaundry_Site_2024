## Altar

Salt my skin

and soak my flesh

These words are the altar

upon which

I sacrifice myself

Burning

and Proud


<br/>

## Helen 

You’re divinity

wrapped in the Old God’s best imitation

of mortal flesh

<br/>

Your name - both spark and fan

to the desires

and ires

of men


<br/>


And though Troy’s walls

are long since fell

Homer could scrawl the same ink

recounting the battles

that rage over you

between my head and my heart


<br/>

## Icarus

To think Icarus a fool

is to never have known

the pull of the untouched sun

nor

how the unsaid

burns far hotter

from within

<br/>

No,
I fear the fall

not half as much

as a life

having never endeavoured

to feel your warmth
<br/>

## Ambrosia

You are Ambrosia itself

<br/>

I crave nothing more

than to drink you in

to have you

Saturate me

the way red wine bleeds into white linen

<br/>

Though mine

is a destitute, chronic love

You,

you could sate me.


<br/>

## Dear Persophone

Drench me in life

Coax Spring from my aching bones

<br/>

Oh, my Persephone

I have been as the Earth

Longing

in frozen slumber

to feel your weightless steps

upon this land.

How it yearns

and blooms

only

for you

<br/>

## Muse

How thoughtful of Hesiod

to hide you away for me

<br/>

Of all the muses

in Theogeny

not one

inspires

as you

<br/>

When all is unwell

and my voice is lost

in the noise

You shun

this cacophonous plight

and sit with me

in marvelous

silence

<br/>

You,

my dearest

are the muse

of Self

With you

I feel

like me again


<br/>

## Reaper

If you were to die

before I’d had my fill

of eternity with you

the Reaper should fear

all that I would do

<br/>

For I

am more passionate

and vengeful

than Orpheus

and you

more precious

than Eurydice
