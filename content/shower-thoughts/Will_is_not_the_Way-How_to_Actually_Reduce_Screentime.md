> "I hate my phone but I cannot, for the life of me, put it down" - me circa 2022 averaging 4 hours of phone screentime a day

Over and over again I tried to get rid of my damn phone. I hated the way it demanded my attention at all hours of the day, yet I felt powerless to do anything about it. I would try, and sometimes even succeed, for days or weeks at a time to limit my phone use, but eventually, I'd get tired of fighting myself, and would find myself 2 hours deep on a reddit scroll wondering where the time went.

At the time, I thought if I could be more disciplined, if I could just *want it bad enough* eventually I would overcome it. 

But was that really what was holding me back - wanting it bad enough?

As someone who believes that a life **is** the moments it's comprised of, the thought of my life being ~1/6th scrolling (4hrs/24hrs), just half of what I spend sleeping, filled me with existential dread. But, even that wasn't enough to stop me. Will could move me, but not for sustainably. This problem needed better solutions than sheer discipline and grit. 

Funnily enough, the brilliant PhD and author of Grit, was the one who pointed out to me that Grit*** was not the way.

Angela Duckworth et al. in their paper "Situational strategies for self-control" shared this insight which became a turning point for me:

> "People with high self-control are often described as having an extraordinary capacity to resist temptation. However, our findings suggest that rather than being better at overcoming temptation through heroic feats of willpower, individuals with high self-control are better at arranging their lives so as to avoid encountering it in the first place."

If she was right, that self-control is more about avoiding temptation than exercising willpower, I had been going about my phone habit all wrong. The question wasn't "how can I want it more and push myself harder?" it was **"How do I arrange my life to avoid encountering the temptation of my phone in the first place?"**

> #FOOTNOTE: the way I'm using Grit here is NOT how Duckworth defines Grit. I just liked the wordplay. for a proper description of her reserach on Grit [#CITE]

## Avoiding Will Exhaustion: Building an ecosystem of self-administered nudges

So, I began my search for the means to avoiding tempation sustainably. 

I hopped from one article to another until I stumbled upon "Nudge" by Thaler and Sunstein. In this book, which turns out to be a key piece in modern behavioral economics, the authors introduce a clever approach called **Nudges**. Think of nudges as gentle pushes that help steer us towards better decisions. They're smart tweaks to our environment that play on the quirks (called biases and heuristics) of how humans make choices, making it more likely for us to pick the healthier or wiser option.

Essentially, instead of trying to force myself to choose to read a book instead of scrolling reddit through brute will-power I can make reading more accessible and seem more fun, while making scrolling more boring. For example:
 
 1. I can make it easier to choose to read by putting my book out in the open by the couch where I relax
 2. I can make it harder to choose to scroll by putting my phone across the room
 3. I can make it less fun to scroll by turning my phone screen black and white


What's amazing is how small these nudges are but how effective they can be at a variety of scales. Researchers in behavioural-economics, psychology, and Human-Computer Interaction, have deployed tons of these nudges to increase the amount of vegetables shoppers buy at the grocery store, help students decide to start their homework earlier, and decrease screentime [#CITE G something, JJW, One-sec app guy's thesis]. Nudges seem to be a consistently effective way to change behaviour for the better without exercising will [Cite meta analyses].

Beyond the science, productivity experts have started leaning on nudge-like interventions as an alternative to grit and raw discipline. The immensely successful self-help book *Atomic Habits* by James Clear is founded on the idea of building up habits by making the choices you want to make easier, and the choices you don't want to make harder over time. Clear writes on his blog:

> "The 1st Law (Cue) Make it obvious. The 2nd Law (Craving) Make it attractive. The 3rd Law (Response) Make it easy. The 4th Law (Reward) Make it satisfying." - James Clear

He adds that to break bad habits, you can reverse these laws: Cue — Make it invisible. Craving — Make it unattractive. Response — Make it difficult. Reward - make it unsatisfying by adding some small consequence.

How might we make something more obvious, attractive, and easy? By deploying nudges!

It's not just Clear either, Ali Abdaal's recent book *Feel Good Productivity*, Make Time by Jake Knapp (Author), John Zeratsky (Author), and more all leverage - if not make core - the idea that you can make the choices you want to make, easier or more enjoyable to make.

At this point, I was sold. If will was not the way, maybe nudges were.

So begins my journey to nudge myself out of my phone and into my life.


### Increase Friction: Dumbing Down my Phone

My first nudges came from the dumbphone trend. Modern smartphones and apps are meticulously crafted to capture and hold your attention in habit forming ways (#TODO for more on how, see Dark Patterns and Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products ) [https://www.deceptive.design/, https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/] So, to avoid the temptation smartphones and apps have been **designed** to manufacture in their users, I needed to break their design.

It was at this point I wanted to go all in and buy a dumbphone like the Nokias of old, alas, there were complications. One in particular.

Everything needs 2 factor authentication (2FA) now. And how do we authenticate? Phone verification. This would've been fine if 2FA stuck to texting passcodes to me, but University of Toronto - where I work - has started using a mobile app now to verify via push notification. My solution needed a middle-ground. Dumbing down my existing phone. Luckily there's a lot of ways to do this.

#### Decrease Attention Grabbing by Turning off Notifications


My view of notifications is that they're nudges designed to pull you out of whatever you're currently doing by exclaiming "I have urgent news for you! Jenny just messaged you on Instagram and also your favourite youtuber posted a short!". Once the notification hooks you, you're in for an hour of youtube shorts and instagram stories. It's a nudge alright, but a nudge for Big Tech's goals, not mine.

If you do nothing else from this list, I recommend you silence your notifications. They'll still be there for you when you **choose** to look at your phone, but they won't force the choice for you anymore. 

Personally, I started by silencing my phone, but I found the quiet of a world without constant pings so much better that I turned off notifications all together. Everything that matters on my phone will be there when I decide to check it. I don't need my phone to tell me I have emails, I have a job, I know I have emails - I'll get to them.

I won't lie to you though, there is a caveat: I missed things.

I missed conversations on discord with my friends, then caught back up on my own time. I missed emails by the hundreds so I scheduled in two daily time blocks to go through emails - on my own terms. I missed calls from my girlfriend (whick sucked!) so I set iOS to make it so that her calls specifically gave me notifications and weren't silent.

See, there's a middle-ground. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. I want to focus and have control over my attention and time, most of the time. But there are some circumstances in which I want to be "distracted", and people I want to have the power to "distract" me. I assume you do too. 

Being completely unreachable isn't a luxury most of us can afford, however we can limit who can reach us and when to varying extents. If you're a parent, you probably want your kids to be able to reach you no matter what. If you're a systems administrator for a hospital, you may need to be reachable at all times if critical systems go down. Some things and some people are our focus even when we're not focusing on them. We can give them access to our attention without giving access to our whole phone.

**EXERCISE:**
As an exercise, I recommend going through your installed apps and your contact list to decide which of them really need the ability to notify you and which can wait for you to go check on them.

Reclaiming your attention is not all or nothing. You can claw back your moments wherever it works for you.
#### Decrease Appeal: Grey-scale and low power mode

Two more settings that make your phone less fun to use are setting it to black and white, and setting it to low power mode. 

Low power mode slows down your screen and makes applications run slower (it limits the juice the cpu is allowed to draw so it's simply can't run that much stuff). Frankly, it makes using your phone suck! Everything is less responsive. Honestly, I can encapsulate it with this: it just feels icky.

To spice things down further, I added a colour filter that makes my phone black and white. This is a built in feature on the iPhone and I imagine on android as well. In the accessibility settings under *Display & Text Size* you can add a colour filter, they have many options for various kinds of colour vision deficiencies (Yay for accessibility features), but I just set it to black and white. 

Surprisingly, this had a massive impact on my phone usage. It's just **so** boring to look at that I get what I need from my phone and get out . The vibrant speedy screen is such a joy to use that it sucks me in - replacing it (without physically replacing it) with a dull, grey, slow, janky brick was awesome for decreasing screen time.
#### Remove Temptation: Uninstall 

Tiktok, youtube, instagram, reddit. Notifications and vibrant screens help suck you in but it's the apps that keep you there. So, get rid of them. 

This may be more difficult for some than others. For example, plenty of people use instagram's messaging as a main means of communication with their friends online. I am definitely not asking you to stop talking to your friends. But, if you've got another device like a laptop or desktop computer, you can still access those applications through the web browser version. This has three benefits:

1. the web browser versions of these applications usually suck which makes them less addictive.
2. your phone is always with you, your laptop likely isn't, and even if you carry it in your backpack, it's a pain to just whip out cause you're bored.
3. you still get to use the parts of the application you want - like messaging.

I made the decision that, on the rare occasion I need to be on social media, I can do that from my laptop. Same with discord, whatsapp, and other messaging platforms except for the basic call and text. I doom scroll less, I don't pull out my phone on the bus except to pick a podcast or listen to music, though sometimes I do just sit with my thoughts, and I don't feel like I miss that much. If I'm meeting up with friends I just let them know "if you need to reach me, text me instead of discord/insta"


### When Will Fails: One sec

So, I implemented all of the above and I found my brain still found clever ways to get its cheap dopamine fix or satisfy anxious "but what if I'm missing something?" self-talk. These were browser apps, slack, and the email app. I had to keep these on my phone for work and because you can't uninstall every browser off your phone - it doesn't let you.

This is where One Sec comes in. One Sec is an app that, instead of completely blocking the use of an app, adds just a sprinkle of friction in the form of a 5 to 10 second pause. When you try to launch an app that you've flagged with One Sec, it throws up a screen that says "take a deep breath." and once the 5 seconds is done it asks "do you really want to open this app?" 

That short nudge is enough for me to ask myself "why do I want to open this app? Is it because I actually need/want to, or was it just an impulse?" If it was an impulse most of the time I don't - most of the time. If I did need it, 5 seconds didn't inconvenience me enough to lose anything important.

I'll link to the app here, and share a more in-depth youtube video here.

One Sec changed the game for me.


## Extending from Phones to Life: Environment Engineering with an ecosystem of nudges


> "Life is the sum of all your choices" - Albert Camus

In this article, I focused on the set of nudges I use for reducing phone screen time from 4 hours to about 20 minutes per day. Best of all, I don't feel will exhaustion with these nudges. It's just easier and less appealing to use my phone than to read, spend time with my partner or friends, go for a walk, or whatever else I actually want to do. 

So, with this great a success, why stop at just screen time? 

We make thousands of choices every day, all of which making up the totality of our lives. Why not give ourselves a little help choosing to do what we actually care about?

From reading more to calling my friends and family more often, from convincing myself to start scary projects to taking healthier breaks, I'm using nudges to shape my world so that it affords me more of what I care about and less of what I don't. If you'll indulge me, I've taken to calling the stacking of nudges in many domains of life *Nudge Ecosystem Engineering* - the practice of constantly conducting little experiments to find the nudges that **actually help you** do more of what you mean to do and less of what you don't. 

It took me a year of experimenting to get my screentime from 4 hours to about 20 minutes (#TODO Screeshot proof). Not only that, I needed an entire toolkit worth of interventions to keep my phone time down - one alone never would have done it and I never would have been able to follow through with all of them at once. It was a slow, iterative process that gradually moved my choices and it was entirely worth it.

To explore the use of self-administered ecosystems of nudges further, I'm making it the focal point of my research at the Intelligent Adaptive Interventions lab at the University of Toronto and sharing my day-to-day applications of nudges in a bi-weekly newsletter and blog called *A Little Better*.

You can find it at *ALittleBetter.org* and join the bi-weekly email newsletter here.

In the coming years, I hope to find more and more ways I can make the life I really want to live, easier to choose through *Nudge Ecosystem Engineering*. Let's hope it works!
